# PyShell

A random python shell. No idea. It's still rather a very basic version.

# Installing

Clone the repo. You have 2 options:

1. Execute via `python main.py`
2. Use `make` then copy `dist/pyshell` to whatever directory you wish that is available on PATH then `pyshell`.

No, i won't provide you with prebuilt binaries yet. It's only a basic one.
